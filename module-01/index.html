<h1>A basic HTML template</h1>
    <p>This is the beginning of my long and wonderful journey into JavaScript programming and mapping.</p>
    <h2>Reaction to the Floating Sheep Manifesto</h2>
    <p>After reading the manifesto, I can say that I hope / intend to be dualy suited for cartography and programming. Currently, having a backgroud of very little programming a little VB, a little FoxPro / sql *ancient*, and working on python, my balance leans far to the cartographer side. I believe I have enough understanding of what i do not know to have a healthy respect of "true" programmers and what they can acomplish. Thus, I have entered this course to help me even further in my endevor to make awesome, and hpefully intriguing maps, and informative products that are useful and very user functional / friendly.
    </p>
    <p>My priorities will always be on quality, meaningfull-ness, and accuracy. These can be nice, comfy, broad terms to cover so many issues.</p>
    
    <p>I find much of the document, the manifesto, amusing. It entertained while addressing real issues of our vocation. I can't say I disagree with any of it... so far. I'll let you know.</p>
